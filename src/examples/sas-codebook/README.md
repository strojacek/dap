# sas-codebook

This repo contains SAS<sup>&reg;</sup> code for producing a PDF summary of each variable in a dataset. Each variable summary is confined to a 1" tall strip, allowing for 9 variables to be summarized on a page. 

Metadata is provided for each variable in **bold text**. This metadata includes the variable's name, label, type, and (if applicable) format. 

Below the metadata are the number of non-missing values, the number of missing values, and the number of unique values.

Continuous variables are summarized graphically using a combination histogram/boxplot. Continuous variables are also summarized tabularly using the mean, standard deviation, min, max, median, and quartiles.

Categorical variables are summarized graphically using horizontal bar charts (or dot plots). Categorical variables are also summarized tabularly using counts and percents.
